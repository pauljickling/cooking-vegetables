# Cooking Vegetables

An infographic developed in React that shows the various cooking techniques available for vegetables throughout the seasons.

## Motivation

I created this project based on two motivations.

1. The information came from the book *Salt, Fat, Acid, Heat* by Samin Nosrat. While the book features a ton of wonderful information and illustrations, I felt this particular chart was lacking in clarity due to the unfortunate choice to have all of the colors used to be various greens. As someone that suffers from partial colorblindness, it was immediately apparent to me that this information could be rendered in a more accessible fashion.

2. For the last half year I have been living in Python land, and I wanted to work on a quick project in Javascript just so I wouldn't forget the fundamentals.

## Why React?

I wrote this project in React. In some ways it is slight overkill, but in others it is the perfect tool for the job. Since this is primarily a UI project, React is certainly an appropriate tool however. Thanks to how React structures components to be rendered, I figure if I decide to improve on the UI it will be easy enough to make changes without having to rewrite everything.
